# caltech_pedestrian_data

This repository shows a way to handle the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset from http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/

with the help of an online repo I found, which worked for me: https://github.com/dbcollection/caltech_pedestrian_extractor . It converts .seq files into .jpg
